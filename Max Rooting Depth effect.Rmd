### I used the parameter file with Half BBslope + Half Vcmax as the base and changed to test three different rooting profiles.

#### Three rooting profiles were designed such that Cumulative Root Fraction (CRF) at depths 0.5, 1 and 2 m, respectively, were nearly at 0.99999 =~1

#### But note that whther the maximum rooting depth is 0.5 or 1, defined as above, there is little addition of roots after 0.4 m.

```{r Chunk 1, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.align = 'center', out.width = "100%", fig.pos = 'H', fig.cap = ""}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path("figures", "Cumulative Root Fraction when Max Rooting depth aroun 1 m.jpeg"))
```

```{r Chunk 2, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.align = 'center', out.width = "100%", fig.pos = 'H', fig.cap = ""}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path("figures", "Root Fraction when Max Rooting depth aroun 1 m.jpeg"))
```

## All three rooting profiles reduced the underestimation of Soil Water content at 1 m, but similarly so, and not as much as I expected. There are likely to be some other parameters responsible to affect further reduction of Soil Water Content.

```{r Chunk 4, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.align = 'center', out.width = "100%", fig.pos = 'H', fig.cap = ""}
current.folder <- "2019-10-14_5000"
knitr::include_graphics(file.path("figures", current.folder, "trial2/swc_Obs_vs_model_daily_horizontal.jpeg"))
```

#### Turns out that the capping of maximum rooting depths caused a heavy underestimation of dry season ET. This means that a maximum rooting depth as large as 2m is definitely not the realistic maximum rooting depth of the forest. 

```{r Chunk 3, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.align = 'center', out.width = "100%", fig.pos = 'H', fig.cap = ""}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path("figures", current.folder, "trial2/ET_Obs_vs_model_daily_all_years_sma_21.jpeg"))
```
